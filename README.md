# TELECOM-BILLING-SYSTEM
The Telecom Billing System is a project developed in C++ that provides a simple billing system for a telecommunications company. The system allows customers to make calls, send messages, and use data, and generates bills based on their usage. The system also provides functionality for managing customer accounts, adding new customers, and viewing billing details.


## Features

- `Customer Management`: The system allows for managing customer accounts, including adding new customers, viewing customer details, and updating customer information such as name, address, and contact information.

- `Billing Generation`: The system generates monthly bills for each customer, calculating the total charges based on the usage details and applicable rates. The bills are displayed with a breakdown of charges for calls, messages, and data, along with the total amount due.
- `Usage Tracking`: The system tracks customer usage of calls, messages, and data, and calculates the charges based on predefined rates. It also keeps a record of the usage details for each customer.
- `Payment Management`: The system allows for recording payments made by customers, updating the payment status, and displaying the outstanding balance.

- `Report Generation`: The system generates reports on customer usage, billing details, and payments received, providing insights into the financial performance of the telecommunications company.


## How to use it

* `Compilation`: Compile the project using a C++ compiler such as GCC or Visual Studio.

* `Input Validation`: The system should include input validation to ensure that only valid inputs are accepted, and appropriate error messages are displayed for invalid inputs. 

* `Data Storage`: The system may store data such as customer details, usage details, billing information, and payment records in memory or in external files, such as text files or databases.
